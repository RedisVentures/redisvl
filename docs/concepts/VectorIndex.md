# Vector Indexing

Vector indexing is a technique used to organize and retrieve data based on vector representations. Instead of storing data in traditional tabular or document formats, vector indices represent data objects as vectors in a multi-dimensional space.

## Why use vectors for data indexing?

The main reason for indexing data as vectors is to capture the semantic similarity or contextual relationships between data objects. By assigning vector values that reflect the similarity or relatedness of objects, the resulting vectors contain meaningful information about the object's meaning and its connections to other data.

To illustrate this concept, consider a two-dimensional space where words can be represented as vectors. Algorithms trained on a large corpus, such as [GloVe](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284576917_Glove_Global_Vectors_for_Word_Representation), can learn the relationships between words and assign vector coordinates to represent their similarity. In this vector space, words with similar meanings or co-occurrence patterns are located close to each other, while dissimilar words are farther apart. This approach extends beyond textual data and can be applied to various types of unstructured data, including images, videos, DNA sequences, and more.

## Choosing the right vector index type

The choice of vector index type depends on the data size, the nature of the data, and the specific use case or business requirements. Choosing the right vector index type is crucial for efficient data retrieval. Different vector index types offer varying trade-offs in terms of query performance, indexing speed, and scalability. Redis supports multiple vector index types, including HNSW and FLAT, giving users the flexibility to choose the most suitable option based on their requirements.

## FLAT Index

The flat indexing method is a straightforward and efficient approach to vector indexing that is commonly used for similarity searches. In this method, data objects or vectors are directly stored in a flat array or list, with each object associated with a unique identifier or index.

Data insertion in the flat indexing method is uncomplicated, as new data objects can be easily appended to the end of the flat array. Similarly, when conducting a search operation, the entire flat array is sequentially scanned to calculate the similarity between the search query vector and all the vectors in the array. The most relevant vectors are then identified based on the similarity metric, and their corresponding indices are returned as search results. Here are two subsections highlighting when it makes sense to use FLAT:

1. Fast and Efficient Search: FLAT is well-suited for applications requiring fast and efficient similarity search. It excels when the focus is on retrieving the most relevant vectors based on similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. FLAT's indexing structure optimizes search performance, making it ideal for use cases where quick retrieval of similar vectors is crucial.

2. Limited Indexing Space: FLAT is a suitable choice when there are limitations on the available indexing space. It provides a compact and memory-efficient index structure, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of vectors even in scenarios with constrained resources. If the application demands a small memory footprint without compromising search capabilities, FLAT can be a favorable option.

## HNSW Index (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a vector index type that has gained popularity for its impressive query times in similarity searches. In scenarios where finding nearest neighbors is crucial, HNSW provides an efficient solution by organizing data objects into hierarchical layers.

The core concept of HNSW lies in creating a multilayered graph structure, where each layer represents a different level of data coarseness. The lowest layer, known as "layer 0," initially contains all data objects, densely connected to enable fast local search operations. On top of layer 0, there are higher layers with progressively fewer data points represented in each layer. These higher layers are constructed in a way that maintains the relative neighborhood relationships of the data, facilitating efficient exploration of the search space.

When a search query is presented, HNSW initiates the search process from the highest layer (top layer). The algorithm quickly identifies a small number of candidate data points that are closest to the query in this layer. This step significantly reduces the exploration space and allows for fast retrieval of potential nearest neighbors.

To further refine the search, HNSW proceeds to lower layers, exploring neighbors from the candidate points found in the previous layer. This iterative process continues until the algorithm reaches the lowest layer, where it ultimately identifies the actual closest data object to the query. By organizing data objects hierarchically, HNSW minimizes the number of hops required to traverse the search space, resulting in exceptionally fast query times.

One of the key advantages of HNSW is its memory efficiency. Unlike other exhaustive indexing methods that require storing all data points, HNSW keeps only the highest layer in cache, dramatically reducing memory requirements. When a higher layer requests neighboring data points, they are loaded on-demand, ensuring that only a small amount of memory is reserved for the active search process.

In summary, vector indexing offers a way to represent and organize data objects as vectors, capturing semantic relationships and enabling efficient retrieval. Choosing the right vector index type is crucial to optimize query performance, indexing speed, and scalability. Multiple vector indexing allows for the selection and utilization of different index types based on specific requirements and priorities.
